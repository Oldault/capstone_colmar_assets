# capstone_colmar_assets

This project is a fully responsive university website. It utilizes most of the CSS functions I am currently practicing, aswell as helps me
to progress in/ learn HTML & CSS.<br>
Please do not hesitate to critique my work, and give me a review of the code/website when both will be mostly finished. As everybody knows;
thats the way one learns, by getting better after learning on the mistakes i made along the way.<br>

<b>Suggestions are also welcome! </b>Such as:
<ul>
  <i>
  <li>Further content</li>
  <li>Potential better design options</li>
  <li>Basic code imporvements</li>
  <li>Additional funtions etc... </li>
  </i>
</ul>
